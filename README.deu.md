Yes, it's in English. The fellow who translates is busy with his studies. If you want to help, raise an issue on the repo. If you don't have the right keyboard (maybe you are working in an English speaking country) the quickest way to translate is to use a machine translator, proofread side by side with the source document, and make corrections when you think it's wrong or clumsy in the target language.

## Cross-platform printing

Print-jobs are rendered as styled HTML and served from an embedded webserver. Your local web browser is launched to load the print-job and give you printing options like paper size, page orientation and margin size. 

So if you have a local browser that can print, and VS Code can launch it, you're in business.

## Classic user experience

The print icon on the toolbar prints the document in the active editor.

If you have a text selection that crosses at least one line-break you can right click and choose `Print` from the context menu to send just the selection to the printer. In the absence of a multi-line selection the entire document is printed. You can control the position of `Print` in this menu, or remove it altogether.

Or you can right-click on a file in the file explorer pane and choose Print from the context menu.

## Highly configurable

There are a number of settings. Most of them you just need to read the descriptions on the settings page, but we're old school and [we wrote a manual.](doc/manual.eng.md) If things aren't going your way, maybe you should read it. If you're having first-use problems, the manual contains a [troubleshooting guide](doc/manual.eng.md#troubleshooting).

Some things you can configure:

- the colour scheme used for syntax colouring
- whether or not you want line numbers
- alternate browser for printing
- line spacing (leave yourself more room for handwritten annotation of code)
